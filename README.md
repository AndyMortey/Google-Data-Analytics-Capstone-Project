# Capstone Project: Cyclistic Bike Share Case Study.
## Introduction:
I started the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate offered on Coursera somewhere this year. The course teaches the six stages of the data analysis process (ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, & act) and how to use tools like SQL, R, Tableau to solve business problems given a set of data. To complete the course, each student is expected to create their own capstone project to prove their understanding of the data analysis process and how it is used in solving business problems in a real world setting. This can be added to a students portfolio. For this purpose, i present my Capstone Project on the Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study.

### Background:
  This involves a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. It currently offers bikes for use to two customer segments: Casuals and Members.The director of marketing believes the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, the team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. 
  
  The marketing department has been tasked with creating a campaign aimed at converting Casuals to Annual Members. To help them complete this business task, the marketing team has assigned me with answering the following question "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"
